## Coffee-machine List with Angular
## Intro
Hello, this is a simple exercise with Angular. It is an easy and interactive tool for ordering pending or completed coffe orders.

## How it works
You have to enter in the form the name of the client and how you want a coffee: type, syze, multiple toppings...and how to pay, with coins or bills. And click on Add, and so on as many times as the user wants.
Once the items have been added, they can be deleted in the next 20 seconds, as an X appears to delete it.
